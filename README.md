## Introduction

This workshop will teach students to use the software, [TreeScaper](https://github.com/whuang08/TreeScaper), to analyze sets of phylogenetic trees. TreeScaper provides a set of visual and quantitative tools for exploring and characterizing the phylogenetic information contained in a tree set. These tools can be broadly categorized into three types: 

1. Utilities for calculating basic information about topologies and bipartitions

2. Visualization of treespace in 2- or 3-dimensional space through non-linear dimensionality reduction

3. Detection and delineation of distinct ‘communities’ of trees using a graph-theoretic approach known as community detection. 

We will explain the theory behind non-linear dimensionality reduction and community detection and how these methods can be used to discover structure in tree sets indicative of various evolutionary scenarios.  A typical analysis pipeline will be demonstrated on a simple simulated dataset and on an empirical data set.  Both data sets will demonstrate the detection of evolutionary phenomena of broad interest to phylogeneticists.  Students will also be encouraged to bring their own datasets and time during the workshop will be devoted to implementing the analysis pipeline demonstrated in class and discussing the structure in the data that was found.
